abstract: In this chapter, we explore the attack surface of Blockchains and possible ways in which this technology can be compromised. Towards this goal, we attribute attack viability in the attack surface to (i) Blockchain cryptographic constructs,(ii) the distributed architecture of the systems using Blockchain, and (iii) the Blockchain application context. For each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining and associated peer behaviors, 51% attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, equivocation, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forking, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, and privacy attacks. We then explore the causal relationship between these attacks and show how one fraudulent activity can lead to the possibility of other attacks. A secondary contribution of this work is outlining effective defense measures taken by the Blockchain technology or proposed by researchers to mitigate the effects of these attacks and patch vulnerabilities in Blockchains. Blockchain has recently stimulated many applications in the digital world, such as cryptocurrency, smart contracts, ledger maintenance, and distributed provenance, among others. Using Blockchain’s transparent and fully distributed peer-to-peer design, those applications can benefit from an appendonly model in which “transactions” accepted in the Blockchain cannot be modified. The transparency of the Blockchain enables storing publicly verifiable and undeniable records. Furthermore, the Blockchain’s peer-to-peer...
